Gatlin: Gating Function Checker for Linux Kernel
-------

This checker figures out critical resource(callee of direct/indirect callsite,
global variable use, interesting struct type and field use) by looking at existing
CAP/LSM/DAC check, then explore which path that uses such resource is not guarded by
those check.

# bugs discovered 

see ```log/bug_report.md```

# prerequisites

* LLVM-6/7/8/9/10/11/12
* compiler with C++14 support

# build

./build.sh

# usage

Example:

```
opt \
    -analyze \
    -load=build/gatlin/libgatlin.so \
    -gatlin \
    -gating=cap \
    -ccv=0 -ccf=1 -cct=0\
    -ccvv=0 -ccfv=0 -cctv=0\
    -cvf=0 \
    -skipfun=skip.fun \
    -skipvar=skip.var \
    -lsmhook=lsm.hook \
    -prt-good=0 -prt-bad=1 -prt-ign=0 \
    -stats \
    vmlinux.bc \
    -o /dev/null 2>&1 | tee log
```

Please make sure ```skip.fun, skip.var and lsm.hook``` is copied to your working directory
or make sure the path specified in the option is correct.

# vmlinux.bc

You need to install wllvm(https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm)
and then use the following command to generate a single bc file.

```
~/linux: make defconfig
~/linux: make CC=wllvm
~/linux: extract-bc vmlinux
```

# Misc: where are the checks, which module should be builtin

* DAC: they are mainly used in file systems(vfs),
       stage/luster and net/sunrpc also have some checks
* LSM: those LSM hooks are scattered around in net/fs/mm/core
* CAP: capability checks are also scattered in different parts of the kernel,
       besides net/fs/mm/core, lots of device drivers also use capability checks

# I want debug info

```
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
```

# resolve indirect call: KMI or CVF

There are two ways to resolve indirect call: KMI and CVF

* KMI: kernel module interface, is built upon human knowledge of linux kernel,
the observation is that most of the callee of indirect callsite is read from
a constant struct which statically stores a function pointer, 
by matching those struct type and indicies we can match indirect call
fairly accurate(over approximate)

* CVF: this method is deprecated, please checkout tag svf if you want to use svf.
This is built upon SVF, and can accurately figure out callee for indirect call,
however this is very slow and memory hungry.
CVF can process a module with ~40k functions in one hour on an Intel Xeon 6132 2.6GHz CPU.

# kernel config
--------------

## Kernel v4.18

1) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig1.config```

generated by ```make allyesconfig```

9978 yes in total

2) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig2.config```

* \- ```AMD_GPU, KASAN, UBSAN, I915, COMPILE_TEST, KEXEC_FILE, KCOV```
* \+ ```DEBUG_INFO``` 

* ```KCOV``` inserts ```__sanitizer_cov_*``` which don't have proper debug info
and will cause llvm-link fail
* ```AMD_GPU``` won't compile,
* ```I915 and KEXEC_FILE``` won't link, because of wchar issue
* ```COMPILE_TEST``` is conflict with ```DEBUG_INFO```,
* ```KASAN, UBSAN``` is irrelevant

8469 yes in total

3) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig3.config```

* \- ```AMD_GPU, I915, KEXEC, KCOV```, same reason as 2)
* \+ ```DEBUG_INFO, COMPILE_TEST```, need to patch DEBUG_INFO to not depend on ```! COMPILE_TEST```

9938 yes in total

* Clang complains 

```
inlinable function call in a function with debug info must have a !dbg location
```

you can use ```opt -strip-debug``` to remove debug info from module completely, 
so that it won't complain

## Kernel 4.18.5

1) allyesconfig1: 9975 yes

2) allyesconfig3: 9939 yes

* \+ DEBUG_INFO
* \- AMDGPU, I915, KCOV, KEXEC_FILE
