Gatlin: Gating Function Checker for Linux Kernel
-------

This checker figures out critical resource(callee of direct/indirect callsite,
global variable use, interesting struct type and field use) by looking at existing
CAP/LSM/DAC check, then explore which path that uses such resource is not guarded by
those check.

#vmlinux.bc

You need to install wllvm(https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm)
and then use the following command to generate a single bc file.

```
~/linux: make defconfig
~/linux: make CC=wllvm
~/linux: extract-bc vmlinux
```

#Misc: where are the checks, which module should be builtin

* DAC: they are mainly used in file systems(vfs),
       stage/luster and net/sunrpc also have some checks
* LSM: those LSM hooks are scattered around in net/fs/mm/core
* CAP: capability checks are also scattered in different parts of the kernel,
       besides net/fs/mm/core, lots of device drivers also use capability checks

#I want debug info

```
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
```

#resolve indirect call: KMI or CVF

There are two ways to resolve indirect call: KMI and CVF

* KMI: kernel module interface, is built upon human knowledge of linux kernel,
the observation is that most of the callee of indirect callsite is read from
a constant struct which statically stores a function pointer, 
by matching those struct type and indicies we can match indirect call
fairly accurate(over approximate)

* CVF: this is built upon SVF, and can accurately figure out callee for indirect call,
however this is very slow and memory hungry.
CVF can process a module with ~40k functions in one hour on an Intel Xeon 6132 2.6GHz CPU.

#kernel config
--------------

##Kernel v4.18

1) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig1.config```

generated by ```make allyesconfig```

9978 yes in total

2) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig2.config```

* \- ```AMD_GPU, KASAN, UBSAN, I915, COMPILE_TEST, KEXEC_FILE, KCOV```
* \+ ```DEBUG_INFO``` 

* ```KCOV``` inserts ```__sanitizer_cov_*``` which don't have proper debug info
and will cause llvm-link fail
* ```AMD_GPU``` won't compile,
* ```I915 and KEXEC_FILE``` won't link, because of wchar issue
* ```COMPILE_TEST``` is conflict with ```DEBUG_INFO```,
* ```KASAN, UBSAN``` is irrelevant

8469 yes in total

3) ```kernel_config/allyesconfig3.config```

* \- ```AMD_GPU, I915, KEXEC, KCOV```, same reason as 2)
* \+ ```DEBUG_INFO, COMPILE_TEST```, need to patch DEBUG_INFO to not depend on ```! COMPILE_TEST```

9938 yes in total

* Clang complains 

```
inlinable function call in a function with debug info must have a !dbg location
```

you can use ```opt -strip-debug``` to remove debug info from module completely, 
so that it won't complain

## Kernel 4.18.5

1) allyesconfig1: 9975 yes

2) allyesconfig3: 9939 yes

* \+ DEBUG_INFO
* \- AMDGPU, I915, KCOV, KEXEC_FILE
